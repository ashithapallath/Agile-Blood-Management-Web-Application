The **Agile Blood Management Web Application** is designed to streamline the process of blood donation and management. It connects donors, recipients, and hospitals, offering a seamless and user-friendly interface for managing blood inventory, donations, and requests.

This project was developed using **React.js** and is part of a collaborative initiative to create an efficient blood management system. This project was done as part of the **Agile coursework project** in collaboration with **Athira Mohandas**.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
You can find more details about running tests in the official React documentation.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build/` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.  
Your app is now ready to be deployed!

For deployment details, see the [React Deployment Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`
**Note**: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you're not satisfied with the default configuration, you can eject. This command removes the single build dependency and exposes configuration files for you to modify. While this grants more control over the build process, it also means you're responsible for managing these configurations.
